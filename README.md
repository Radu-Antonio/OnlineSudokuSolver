# OnlineSudokuSolver
I built a python web scraper that solves a sudoku board on the [ro.sudokuonline.eu](http://ro.sudokuonline.eu/) site.

In order to be able to run the script you need to have Google Chrome and to install selenium with: 
```
pip install selenium
```

And to install the chromedriver from [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) for your respective OS, in to the C drive.

Now just run the script and watch it solve ðŸ˜Ž.
